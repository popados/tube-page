        I made everyone happy by playing every weapon so it's time to make myself happy by playing one of my favorite
        weapon</p>

        I know there are a lot of DMC fans in my subscribers so this video is for you
        This video took me way longer than expected lol. I had some fun with the slow motions, I hope you enjoy. This
        song is so epic but it's a hell to edit, first because it's a 9 minutes song and I can't do a 9 minutes video
        but it's hard to remove some parts as they are all awesome. Second because there are parts that are very slow
        and other parts that are very fast
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially I wanted to do a mashup World/Rise video but they don't seem to perform well. I had way enough clips
        with just World anyway</p>
